            I dont want to see her dreams go in vain. I dont want to witness any
            fingers pointing at her for mistakes she never made. I want her to
            be respected by everyone, to stand confidently on her own feet, and
            to feel immense pride. In the end, I aspire to see her radiant with
            happiness as all her desires and dreams come to fruition.
